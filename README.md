Blank | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Z     |   | . | , | ? | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
E     | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |
C     | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P |
H     | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |

This is my own cipher. Same idea of Multidimentional Array in programming languages.

Encode:
- print name of array
- print position

Decode:
- find the value of name of array and it's position

### Example
Encode: Zech
Z = H[9] -> H9
e = E[8] -> e8
c = E[6] -> e6
h = C[1] -> c1

Therefore, Zech = H9e8e6c1

Decode: E5h1c8c7
E5 = B
h1 = r
c8 = o
c7 = n

Therefore, E5h1c8c7 = Bron


### I have wild imagination. But I don't know how to program this shit.
